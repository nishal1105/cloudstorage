☁️Created my OWN PERSONAL CLOUD STORAGE 💻💽

Used File Cloud to create my own personal encrypted unlimited cloud storage

🚀Step 1 :- Launch a EC2 Instance with File Cloud AMI (t2.Medium is recommended)

☁️Step 2 :- Sign-up for a File Cloud community account to get started

🪣Step 3 :- Create a amazon S3 Bucket and link it the EC2 created earlier, then configure the EC2 File Cloud File to have Amazon S3 as default storage option (Using CLI)

🙌Step 4 :- Create a user and enjoy unlimited cheap Cloud Storage by going to the Public IPv4 DNS address of your instance.

Now everytime you upload a file on File Cloud the same file will be reflected on your Amazon S3😀
